# Malnutrition Trends and Analysis

Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy (caloric) requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is essential for good health. Undernourishment, especially in children and mothers, is a leading risk factor for death and other health consequences.

The purpose is to study about the Malnutrition and its dependent variables, as always it’s a global challenge. 
In this presentation we will be representing the following:
1) World wide Malnutrition trend
2) Highest affected continents 
3) Tableau is the best solution to analyze this type of data. So the visuals used are as: Heat map, Tree map, Horizontal Bar Graph, Line Graph. 

This dataset is retrieved from https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/malnutrition/

Extracted two datasets from the available contents:  
1) UNICEF/WHO/World Bank joint child malnutrition estimates (global and regional) 
2) Overlapping Malnutrition Estimates

# Variables used and their description: 
  1) Stunting: Refers to a child who is too short for his or her age. These children can suffer severe irreversible physical and cognitive damage that accompanies stunted growth
  2) Overweight: Refers to a child who is too heavy for his or her height. This form of malnutrition results from energy intakes from food and beverages that exceed children’s   energy requirements. 
  3) Wasting: Refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height. Wasting is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. 

# Business Questions that I aim to solve with this dashboard
1) Which parts of the world has the highest malnutrition rate?
2) What are the possible reasons for malnutrition?
3) Does the poverty line affects the malnutrition ?
4) Why was rural area affected the most?
5) Which year has impacted the most by malnutrition and why?
